# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kalshi AI Trading Bot project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Edge engines** (`src/engines/`, `cli.py engines ...`, MCP `engines_scan` / `engines_paper`) —
  model-driven pricing that plugs into the guard stack instead of around it. See
  **[docs/ENGINES.md](docs/ENGINES.md)**.
  - Shared core: per-series Kalshi fees from `GET /series` (`fee_type`, `fee_multiplier`,
    maker fees only where enabled); normalized quotes and live order-book depth; a fee-aware
    evaluator that shrinks each engine toward the market by its *earned* trust weight, values
    maker fills at the posted price, and sizes with capped fractional Kelly; a portfolio
    selector with per-market, per-event and per-scan budgets.
  - `weather`: NOAA NBM station forecasts at the exact NWS settlement station, calibrated per
    station against IEM's archive of CLI reports, truncated by quality-controlled observations.
    Walk-forward backtest over 2,180 settled events: **no edge** (market Brier 0.104 vs 0.119;
    simulated trading -$888, t = -2.2), so its earned weight is 0 and it abstains.
  - `arbitrage`: all-NO, proven-exhaustive all-YES and same-subject ladders across the whole
    open universe (~16s), walked off live depth to the profit-maximizing basket count;
    live baskets preflight every leg through the guards before sending any.
  - Paper ledger (`engines run` is dry by default; `engines paper --settle` scores engine vs
    market log loss and P&L, inferring maker fills from later prints).
  - `games` engine: Kalshi game winners (NFL, CFB, MLB, NHL, NBA, WNBA) vs a consensus of the
    de-vigged DraftKings line and Polymarket's CLOB book, matched via `sports-skills`
    (optional extra: `pip install -e ".[engines]"`). Untested by design (no sportsbook archive);
    shadow-only until its paper record earns trust.
  - Shadow paper trading + `engines promote <engine>`: untrusted engines record what they would
    trade at full trust (never sent), and earn trust only from that settled record (log loss
    beats the market at z >= 2 AND positive P&L). `calibrate --weight` removed.
  - oracle3 cross-check (`src/engines/crosscheck.py`): every risk-free basket is re-priced by
    oracle3's `check_constraint` when installed; unconfirmed baskets are never traded.
  - Review fixes (two-axis review, `skills` repo method): whole-basket cash preflight, per-leg
    unhedged-excess reporting, de-duplicated live plan, uncertainty margin kept on resize,
    ledger scores the engine's own probability, arbitrage capped by the per-event budget.
  - `place_guarded_order` takes optional `strategy` / `method` tags (backward-compatible), so
    engine trades are journaled as `method=engine:<name>` and the Edge Policy can block a
    losing engine by itself.
- **TypeSafe Jev support** (`~typesafe/jev-latest`, OpenRouter Decisions API) — measured, not
  hyped: see **[docs/JEV.md](docs/JEV.md)**. `cli verify --jev` floors the skeptic's
  true-YES at Jev's independent P(YES) (stricter-only); `src/agent/jev.py` +
  `scripts/jev_classify.py` batch-classify text against a market rule (~50k pairs/min,
  206/207 on endorsement posts); `scripts/jev_backtest.py` reproduces the blind test
  where Jev lost to the book (Brier 0.209 vs 0.157, n=601).
- **`cli report` shows all-time drawdown** after a governor peak re-baseline (read from
  `data/runtime/governor_audit.jsonl`), so a reset never hides a drawdown publicly.

### Fixed
- **`KalshiClient.cancel_order`** used the deprecated v1 path (HTTP 410); it now calls
  `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{id}`.

### Added (earlier this cycle)
- **`cli verify --research-file`** — run the adversarial-verify gate with **no LLM
  API key**: supply the research + skeptic judgments as JSON (a human or agent does
  them out-of-band), and the deterministic gate still recomputes the edge off the
  live orderbook, so the fade can't be fudged by optimistic pricing.
- **`cli report`** — renders a public **[Live Track Record](docs/TRACK_RECORD.md)**
  from the persisted settlements / journal / policy, losses included. The account
  section is explicitly framed as *blended* (operator manual trades + autonomous
  strategy) so a manual-driven drawdown is never misread as the strategy failing;
  the strategy's real edge lives in the journal-based metrics. Offline-capable.
- **`cli fills`** — reconciles the decision journal against actual order fills:
  voids records whose maker orders were cancelled unfilled and shrinks partial
  fills, so calibration and the Edge Policy only ever learn from trades that
  actually executed (no phantom predictions).
- **`scripts/capture_corpus.py`** — captures a daily price snapshot of the full
  open-market universe to `data/corpus/` (idempotent per UTC day). Joined against
  settlements, this is the entry-price corpus a real out-of-sample backtest needs.
- **Non-sports longshot bucket** in `scripts/hunt_candidates.py` — surfaces the
  pond where researched fades actually pay (liquid sports books are already sharp).
- **The self-improvement loop is closed.** A new data-driven **Edge Policy**
  (`src/agent/policy.py`) turns your settled track record into a pre-trade gate:
  it **blocks** category/method groups your record proves lose money (≥5 settled
  trades, negative realized P&L), **warns** on a net-negative side (advisory — a
  losing side never disables the whole strategy), and **haircuts** `est_prob`
  bands where you're ≥10pp overconfident. Honest gating throughout: a group with
  fewer than 5 settled trades earns no rule.
- **`cli policy`** — read-only view of the gate your settled record earns
  (`--demo` runs on a shipped fixture, no keys needed; `--json` for machines).
- **`cli improve`** — the loop end to end: settle → reconcile → re-derive the
  policy → diff what the newest settlements changed → persist the active gate.
  `--dry` previews; falls back to the local settlements log when offline.
- **Edge Policy gate in `place_guarded_order`.** A blocked category/method is a
  hard refusal (`blocked_by_policy`); the agent keeps full authority via
  `cli trade --override-policy` (the override is recorded). Backward-compatible:
  no policy file means no opinion, so nothing changes until you run `improve`.
- **MCP `policy` tool** — the gate is now drivable from Claude Desktop/Code
  (read-only, derives fresh in memory).
- `settle.settlement_to_record` / `series_category` — adapt Kalshi's
  authoritative settlements into journal-shaped records so the policy learns
  from real outcomes, with the Kalshi series prefix as the category.

### Changed
- `cli backtest` no longer claims a fake "coming soon" engine. It honestly
  explains that a strategy backtest needs a captured price/outcome corpus this
  repo doesn't ship yet, and points to the feedback loop (`edge`/`policy`/
  `improve`) that works today without one.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **`pytest` is now safe to run by default.** Tests that hit the real Kalshi
  API — several of which place real orders — are marked `live` and skipped
  unless `RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1` is set. Previously, running the test suite with a
  configured `.env` could place real-money orders.
- **`pip install -e .` works again.** The declared build backend
  (`setuptools.backends._legacy:_Backend`) does not exist, and `setup.py` was
  an interactive wizard that setuptools executed (and hung on) during every
  install. The backend is now `setuptools.build_meta` and the wizard lives at
  `setup_env.py`.
- Balance guard in order execution: live orders are skipped (fail-closed) if
  the account balance cannot be verified or is insufficient for the order.
- `MODEL_PRICING` was missing entries for `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` (the
  default model), `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`, and `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`,
  so the daily AI cost limit was not tracking their spend.
- Replaced 6 bare `except:` clauses (which also swallow
  `asyncio.CancelledError` and can block shutdown) with narrow handlers.
- Fixed placeholder `yourusername` URLs in `pyproject.toml` and the broken
  mocked execution test.

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI: test suite (no secrets required) + gitleaks secret scan.
- `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting and credential-handling guidance.
- Regression test: orders exceeding the available balance are refused.

### Removed
- `requirements.txt` (and stale `requirements-dev.txt` /
  `dashboard_requirements.txt` references) — `pyproject.toml` is the single
  source of truth: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` / `".[dashboard]"`.
- One-off debug scripts `verify_fix.py` and `test_live_mode.py` from the
  repo root.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Split the 1,300-line `portfolio_optimization.py` into the
  `src/strategies/portfolio/` package (`models`, `optimizer`, `immediate`,
  `runner`). `portfolio_optimization.py` remains as a compatibility shim, so
  all existing imports — including in forks — keep working unchanged.
- Consolidated the Kelly criterion kernel into `src/utils/position_sizing.py`.
  It was previously implemented three times (twice in
  `portfolio_optimization`, once in `safe_compounder`) with subtle
  differences. Strategy-level policy (fractional multipliers, regime/time
  adjustments, caps) is unchanged; behavior is pinned by 28 characterization
  tests in `tests/test_position_sizing.py`.
- `market_making._calculate_optimal_sizes` docstring now states that its
  formula is a linear edge scaler, not Kelly (the math itself is untouched).
